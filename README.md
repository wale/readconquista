# Readconquista
Readconquista is a hobbyist project on collecting library cards around the bounds of the [Greater Melbourne Area](https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/about-melbourne/Pages/about-melbourne.aspx), in Victoria, Australia.

## About
This project covers all public library services within the boundaries of Melbourne, as well as some university library systems and standalone public libraries. 

In cities such as Melbourne, most public libraries are not run by a city government (due to a lack of such), rather that they are run by disparate ["local government areas"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Australia), or companies that straddle multiple local government areas.

The source code of the Readconquista site itself is written with [NuxtJS 3](https://nuxt.com) & [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com).
